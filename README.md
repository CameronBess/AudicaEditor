# AudicaEditor

## How to use
* Convert your music to OGG-VORBIS `.ogg` and place in the root folder with the .exe
* If you have one, add your `song.desc`to the same folder
* If you have one, add your `.cues` to the same folder
* AudicaEditor will always load the `.cues` that comes first alphabetically
* Export will always save results to edica.cues - be careful not to overwrite your previous work

*If you have already started charting a track*, your beat markers may not line up with the grid properly - find the correct offset value to match the timeline beat grid to the music, and add an entry to `song.desc` that reads `"offset": x` where x is the offset you found
