# AudicaEditor

## How to use
* Convert your music to OGG-VORBIS `.ogg` before use
* Export will always save results to edica.cues - be careful not to overwrite your previous work
* Save will give you a .audica file. This file can be used to save progress on your map without exporting it.


*If you have already started charting a track*, your beat markers may not line up with the grid properly - find the correct offset value to match the timeline beat grid to the music, and add an entry to `song.desc` that reads `"offset": x` where x is the offset you found


## Converting previous work to a .edica file:
THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY FOR USERS WHO ARE COMING FROM OTHER EDITORS (or older versions of this editor)

1. Create a folder
2. Place you .cue .desc (if you have one) and .ogg files in said folder
3. Select the files and create a zip file containing only those 3 files (make sure they are not contained in a folder in the zip)
4. Change the .zip file extension to .edica
5. In edica when prompted select "Load .edica file" and navigate to the file you created
