# AudicaEditor

## How to use
* If you want to change the resolution of the application hold the shift key while launching Edica
* Convert your music to OGG-VORBIS `.ogg` before use
* Export will always save results to edica.cues - be careful not to overwrite your previous work
* Save will give you a .audica file. This file can be used to save progress on your map without exporting it.


*If you have already started charting a track*, your beat markers may not line up with the grid properly - find the correct offset value to match the timeline beat grid to the music, and add an entry to `song.desc` that reads `"offset": x` where x is the offset you found


## Converting previous work to a .edica file:
THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY FOR USERS WHO ARE COMING FROM OTHER EDITORS (or older versions of this editor)

1. Open edica
2. Click "New edica project" and select the `.ogg` file for the song
3. Click "Import .cues"
4. You can now edit the project as normal. When saving, the project will be saved in the `.edica` format automatically.
